# Classic Arcade Game Clone – “Save your girl!"

<img src="images/arcade-game.gif" />

## Why This Project?

Games have a lot of objects and those objects do a lot of different things; but sometimes they do some very similar things as well. This creates a great opportunity to practice object-oriented programming, an important programming paradigm that influences your application architecture and provides performance optimization.
